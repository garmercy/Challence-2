# :cake: Flavia Aguirre Portfolio :cake:

I created this web application portfolio of a chef-cake designer with not starting codes.
The goals of this project are:

* Create an online presence.
* Showcase of products and services to potential customers.
* Establish the brand.
* Increase sales and revenues.
* Allow potential customers to find the company.
* Create the website according to the client's requirements (font style, colors, website structure..)

## User Story

As an employer:
* _I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position_

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio :

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
